# BERT-based Question Answering Model

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the use of a **BERT-based model** for **Question Answering**. The model leverages the `bert-base-multilingual-cased` pre-trained model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library to answer questions based on provided contexts. The system can handle both English and Bengali questions and contexts, making it multilingual.

## Features
- **Question Answering (QA)**: Given a question and context, the model identifies and outputs the most relevant answer from the context.
- **Multilingual**: Supports multiple languages, including English and Bengali.
- **Synthetic Data**: Includes synthetic questions and contexts for demonstration purposes.

## Requirements

### Libraries:
- **Transformers**: For model and tokenizer loading.
- **Datasets**: To handle the synthetic dataset and convert it to the required format.
- **Torch**: To run the model.
- **Pandas**: To manage and manipulate data.

To install the required dependencies, use the following:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets pandas
